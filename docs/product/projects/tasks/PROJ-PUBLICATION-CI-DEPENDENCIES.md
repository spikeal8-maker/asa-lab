# Public Projects: verification baseline dependencies

Parent programme: TASK-PROJ-R7-VISIBLE-PUBLICATION-001, Issue #211.
The controller selects two separate bounded C repairs under AGENTS.md sections
2.1 and 7. These support the first visible publication increment. They do not
authorize another product feature, deployment, working database action, runtime
change or weakening of a gate.

## Scratch type checking

TASK-PROJ-PUBLICATION-TYPECHECK-BASELINE-001.
Author branch: `codex/projects-typecheck-baseline`.

Actual failure: Scratch Focused run39144252514/job117724748652 on
`a1283b27ecad266053d403a25a041c21172546a8`.
Only two ESLint configurations differ from its main baseline; the failing
TypeScript roots and gate are unchanged. The manual NodeNext command includes
browser diagnostics and React tests without their browser module resolution,
existing build declaration or JSX setting.

Owned paths: `tools/blocks/gate.mjs` and
`tests/blocks/save-diagnostics.spec.ts`.
Keep all 37 original root inputs and strict options. Check API roots under
NodeNext and browser roots under the actual web settings with the existing
build-metadata declaration. Restore the optional test-only act flag faithfully.
Do not change application runtime, Scratch autosave, dependency versions,
compiler strictness, Vitest/ESLint coverage or Docker.

Acceptance: complete uncached `pnpm gate:blocks`, exact root/option comparison,
independent final-source review, and actual Node 22 Scratch CI.

## Exact upgrade catalogue

TASK-PROJ-PUBLICATION-MIGRATION-BASELINE-001.
Author branch: `codex/projects-migration-baseline`.

Actual failure: general run39144252513/job117725991526 on the same baseline:
4364 tests passed, one failed because the explicit catalogue stops at0214 while
main includes0215,0216,0217. The public-projects diff is absent from that run.

Owned path: `tests/migration/course-structure-forward-upgrade.pg.spec.ts`.
Reuse the completed test blob from PR607
(`af4d897685238eecb395970cdf2702f21969c654`), also present unchanged in PR609.
That exact prepared source passed the real PostgreSQL data job
run39134848479/job117698625866, including the Course forward-upgrade test and RLS.
The aggregate workflow failed elsewhere; do not misreport it as overall PASS.
Existing branches remain intact.

Explicitly extend the prepared exact catalogue through the already published0217.
Retain the two exact ordered lists, historical Course draft/version/run snapshots,
pre153 preservation, idempotency, roles and RLS checks. Do not replace equality
with a subset or derive the expected list from the implementation under test.
No schema, migration script or Learning runtime modification is selected.
Publication migration0218 requires its own synchronous test-list extension in
the publication candidate; a test-only baseline through0217 cannot certify0218.

Acceptance: formatter/diff checks, exact catalogue audit, independent final-source
review and real PostgreSQL forward-upgrade plus general data gate.

## Integration

The existing independently reviewed ESLint prerequisite remains separately
selected in `PROJ-PUBLICATION-BUILD-BASELINE.md`. The controller may assemble
these finished bounded sources into a new verification integration candidate,
preserving their commits and authored bytes. C defects are not repaired inside
the Public Projects feature slice or concealed by changing its gate.
The final combined SHA requires independent review and the relevant actual CI.
An old cancelled run or a passing isolated check is not combined acceptance.

The first publication candidate remains unaccepted until its lock-order,
Learning compatibility, PostgreSQL and built-browser checks pass. Its repair
commit `7745b5f4bc9d52d759562f4ce092ca94c7381ee7` has begun that new CI cycle.
